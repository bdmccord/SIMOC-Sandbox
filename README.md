# SIMOC-Sandbox

SIMOC, A Scalable Model of an Isolated, Off-world Colony, is a proposal to study
and development of resource allocation model for a scalable human colony. At a fundamental level,
the model creates a systematic way of allocating and consuming resources such as air, food, water, and power.

# Getting Started

The agent-based model used for the bulk of the SIMOC simulating requires a modified version of
an agent-based modeling package called Mesa. To download this package, run the command below in
your terminal.

> pip3 install mesa

Once this package is install, move into the SIMOC_Models directory and run the command the below.

> python3 setup.py

This script will make the necessary changes to the mesa package.
